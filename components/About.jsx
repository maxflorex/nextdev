                            I am a self-taught front-end web developer with
                            experience building full-stack applications. My
                            journey in tech began while I was studying graphic
                            design, where I created user interfaces for web and
                            mobile applications that quickly grew into my
                            passion. In recent years, I have been focusing on
                            coding and programming which has become a true love
                            of mine. Originally from Honduras, Central America,
                            I currently live with my wife, daughter, and our
                            four dogs. I strive to stay current with the latest
                            trends and technologies in the tech industry,
                            allowing me to create the most innovative and
                            efficient solutions for any given project.
